Q - Longest Palindromic Substring

Problem Description

Given a string A of size N, find and return the longest palindromic substring in A.

Substring of string A is A[i...j] where 0 <= i <= j < len(A)

Palindrome string:
A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, A is palindrome if reverse(A) = A.

Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 6000



Input Format

First and only argument is a string A.



Output Format

Return a string denoting the longest palindromic substring of string A.



Example Input

Input 1:
A = "aaaabaaa"
Input 2:
A = "abba


Example Output

Output 1:
"aaabaaa"
Output 2:
"abba"


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
We can see that longest palindromic substring is of length 7 and the string is "aaabaaa".
Explanation 2:
We can see that longest palindromic substring is of length 4 and the string is "abba".


Approach - 

A simpler approach, O(N2) time and O(1) space:

In fact, we could solve it in O(N2) time without any extra space.

We observe that a palindrome mirrors around its center. Therefore, a palindrome can be expanded from its center, and there are only 2N-1 such centers.

You might be asking why there are 2N-1 but not N centers?

The reason is that the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters.

Such palindromes have even number of letters (such as “abba”) and their center are between the two ‘b’s.

Since expanding a palindrome around its center could take O(N) time, the overall complexity is O(N2).

Code - 

   public String longestPalindrome(String A) {
        int start = 0, maxLen = 0;
        int n = A.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
           
            int len1 = expandFromCenter(A, i, i);
          
            int len2 = expandFromCenter(A, i, i + 1);

          
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);

          
            if (len > maxLen) {
                maxLen = len;
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
            }
        }

        return A.substring(start, start + maxLen);
    }

    private int expandFromCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1; // Final length
    }
