Q -  Largest Number

Given an array A of non-negative integers,
 arrange them such that they form the largest number.

Note: The result may be very large, 
so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

Problem Constraints

1 <= len(A) <= 100000
0 <= A[i] <= 2*109

Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 3, 9, 0]


Example Output

Output 1:

 "9534330"

Output 2:

 "9320"


Approach - 

Sorting all numbers in descending order is the simplest solution that occurs to us.
But this doesn’t work. 

For example, 548 is greater than 60, but in the output,
 60 comes before 548.
As a second example, 98 is greater than 9,
 but 9 comes before 98 in the output.

The solution is to use any comparison-based sorting algorithm.
 Thus, instead of using the default comparison, 
 write a comparison function myCompare() and use it to sort numbers. 

Given two numbers, X and Y, how should myCompare()
 decide which number to put first – we compare two numbers XY
  (Y appended at the end of X) and YX (X appended at the end of Y). 

If XY is greater, then, in the output, 
X should come before Y, else Y should come before X. 

For example, let X and Y be 542 and 60.
 To compare X and Y, we compare 54260 and 60542. 
 Since 60542 is greater than 54260, we put Y first.

Code - 

public class Solution {
    public String largestNumber(int[] A) {
        
        Integer[] updated = new Integer[A.length];

        for( int i=0; i<A.length; i++){
            updated[i] = A[i];

        }


        Arrays.sort(updated, new largestComparator());

        if(updated[0] == 0){
            return new String("0");
        }

        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();

        for(int a: updated){
            ans.append(a);
        }

        return ans.toString();
    }
}

class largestComparator implements Comparator<Integer> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Integer a, Integer b){
        String order1 = a.toString() + b.toString();
        String order2 = b.toString() + a.toString();

        return order2.compareTo(order1);
    }
}


Q - Factors sort

You are given an array A of N elements. 
Sort the given array in increasing order of number of distinct factors
 of each element, i.e., element having the least number of
  factors should be the first to be displayed and the number 
  having highest number of factors should be the last one. 
  If 2 elements have same number of factors, then number with less 
  value should come first.

Note: You cannot use any extra space

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 104
1 <= A[i] <= 104

Example Input

Input 1:
A = [6, 8, 9]
Input 2:
A = [2, 4, 7]


Example Output

Output 1:
[9, 6, 8]
Output 2:
[2, 7, 4]

Count factors for each element.
Create a new array with [element, factor count] pairs.
Sort this new array based on factor count (and value if counts are equal).
Extract the sorted elements.


Optimization - using custom comparator 

Code - 

public class Solution {
    public int[] solve(int[] A) {
        
        Integer[] updated = new Integer[A.length];

        for(int i=0; i<A.length; i++){
            updated[i] = A[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(updated, new FactorsComparator());
     

             for(int i=0; i<A.length; i++){
            A[i] = (int) updated[i];
        }


        return A;
    }
}


class FactorsComparator implements Comparator<Integer>{


    public int cntFactors(int n){

        int cnt=0;
        

        for(int i=1; i*i<=n; i++){

            if(n%i == 0){

               int b = n/i;

                if( i == b){
                    cnt++;
                }else{
                    cnt = cnt +2;
                }
            }
        }

        return cnt;
    }

    @Override
    public int compare(Integer a, Integer b){

        int factorsA = cntFactors(a);
        int factorsB = cntFactors(b);

        if(factorsA < factorsB){
            return -1;
        }else if( factorsA > factorsB){
            return 1;
        }else{

           if( a<b) return -1;
           else if(a>b) return 1;
           else return 0;
        }
    }
}


Q - Quick Sort

Given an integer array A, sort the array using Quick Sort.

Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Example Input

Input 1:-
A = [1, 4, 10, 2, 1, 5]

A = [3, 7, 1]


Example Output

        return A;

    }

    public void quickSort(int[] A, int l, int r){

        if( l < r){
            int pi = quickSelect(A, l, r);
            quickSort(A, l, pi-1);
            quickSort(A, pi+1, r);
        }
    }

    public int quickSelect(int[] A, int l, int r){

        int pi = A[l];
        int left=l+1;
        int right = r;


        while( left <= right){

            if(A[left] < pi) left++;
            else if( A[right] > pi) right--;
            else{
                swap(A, left, right);
                left++;
                right--;
            }


        }

            swap(A, l, right);
            return right;
    }

    public void swap(int[] A, int left, int right){
        int temp = A[left];
        A[left]= A[right];
        A[right] = temp;
    }

    
Q - Wave Array

Given an array of integers A, sort the array into a wave-like array and return it.
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that

a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5..... 
NOTE: If multiple answers are possible, return the lexicographically smallest one.



Problem Constraints

1 <= len(A) <= 106
0 <= A[i] <= 106

Example Input

Input 1:

Input 2:

A = [1, 2]


Example Output

Output 1:

[2, 1, 4, 3]
Output 2:

[2, 1]


Appraoch - Sort the array and then swap the two nearby elements.

Code - 

  public int[] wave(int[] A) {

        // sort the array and swap the elements 

        Arrays.sort(A);

        for(int i=0; i<A.length; i+=2){

            if(i+1 < A.length){
                swap(A, i, i+1);
            }
        }

        return A;

    }

    public static void swap(int[] A, int i, int j){
        int temp = A[i];
        A[i] = A[j];
        A[j] = temp;
    }


    Q - B Closest Points to Origin

    You are developing a feature for Zomato that helps users find the nearest restaurants to their current location. It uses GPS to determine the user's location and has access to a database of restaurants, each with its own set of coordinates in a two-dimensional space representing their geographical location on a map. The goal is to identify the "B" closest restaurants to the user, providing a quick and convenient way to choose where to eat.

Given a list of restaurant locations, denoted by A (each represented by its x and y coordinates on a map), and an integer B representing the number of closest restaurants to the user. The user's current location is assumed to be at the origin (0, 0).

Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

NOTE: Euclidean distance between two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) is sqrt( (x1-x2)2 + (y1-y2)2).


Problem Constraints

1 <= B <= length of the list A <= 105
-105 <= A[i][0] <= 105
-105 <= A[i][1] <= 105

Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [ 
       [1, 3],
       [-2, 2] 
     ]
 B = 1
Input 2:

 A = [
       [1, -1],
       [2, -1],
       [3, 3],
       [-2, 4]
    ] 
 B = 3


Example Output

Output 1:

 [ [-2, 2] ]
Output 2:

 [ [1, -1], [2, -1], [3, 3] ]

 Approach - 

 Sort the array based on Euclidean distance from the origin and then 
 return first B elements from the sorted array.

 As we do not require exact Euclidean distance below formula will do the trick - 

 dist = (x2-x1) * ( x2-x1) + (y2-y1) * (y2-y1)

 we want to calculate the distance from origin (0, 0) we can eliminate the x1 and y1 from the above formula.

 dist = x*x + y*y;

 Code - 

  public int[][] solve(int[][] A, int B) {

        // sort based on euclcidien distance and return first B elements from sorted
        // as i will be comparing the distance then do not have to calculate the exact squared root distance
        // dist = (x2-x1) * ( x2-x1) + (y2-y1) * (y2-y1) this formula will work as we just want to compare the distance.

        Point[] updated = new Point[A.length];

        for( int i=0; i < A.length; i++){
            Point p = new Point();
            p.x= A[i][0];
            p.y= A[i][1];
            p.distance = euclideanDistance(A[i][0], A[i][1]);
            updated[i] = p;
        }

        Arrays.sort(updated, new distanceComparator());

        int[][] ans = new int[B][2];

        for( int i =0; i< B; i++){
            ans[i][0] = updated[i].x;
            ans[i][1] = updated[i].y;
        }

        return ans;
    }

        public static double euclideanDistance(int x, int y){
        return x*x + y*y;
    }

}
